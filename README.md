# Psychic Game

This game challenges the user to guess what letter the computer has randomly picked from the English alphabet. 
If the user guesses correctly or has 9 incorrect guesses, the game resets and the computer picks a new letter. 

Using Javascript and HTML, the application also keeps track of how many wins and losses the user has and displays that information on the webpage. 

This application can be easily expanded and scaled to fit any theme you can think of.
